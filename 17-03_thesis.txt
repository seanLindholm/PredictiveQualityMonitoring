Stages:

RAW -scan (images) - Mid section x and y + CNN/AE reduction
	- NO CA YM Time_betw_scan CA humidty, CA Temperatur
	* Output -> DEA score or the likes giving some score


CA -scan (images) - Mid section x and y + CNN/AE reduction
	- GOT CA CA humidity CA Tempearture + Output from RAW 
	- NO YM Time_betw_scan
	* Output -> DEA score or the likes giving some score


YM -scan (images) - Mid section x and y + CNN/AE reduction
	- GOT CA CA humidity CA Tempearture Time between scan, YM + Output from YM 
	* Output -> DEA score or the likes giving some score
	

Questions:

- Can we train a model from a stage at YM and then "just" NULL (or zero) all missing values?
- Is it enough to look at the baggrund removal picture of the sensor?
- 

Workplan:
- Gather/saving bcr files each week (maybe save it in DB)
- Scrap AE and go with CNN
- Model for each stage (connect/disconnect)
	* Flexible enough to explore
	* maybe three outputs that maps to DEA
	* connected final output comes from YM is DEA
	
- DEA score as label/target
- possiblity to explore differnet areas (img) - img cuts (proccessing)
- Statistical models
